II.What I like about the front end :
1. Clean and simple layout of webpage
2. Appropriate text and background color matching
3. Large-size font make everything clear
Ps: Good Messi photos

III.What features of the frontend appear to not function properly
In profile page, for account_name validation, username which is formed only by characters, eg. “aa”, can’t pass validation. Also, webpage could have informed users what format is correct when getting a wrong format input.

IV.What features seem to be missing from the frontend
Didn’t show the list of comments when comment button is clicked.

V.What functionality in the frontend was difficult or non-intuitive to use
The buttons redirecting to Profile and mainpage need to be double clicked. However, most buttons on today’s websites usually only need to be clicked once.
